## Hi there ðŸ‘‹
This is just a simple project written in HTML, CSS, and JS to speed up the process of scanning IP addresses using Virus Total and IBM X-Force. Please use the following syntax when pasting IP addresses into the text box:

1xx.xxx.xxx
2xx.xxx.xxx
3xx.xxx.xxx
I wrote it to detect a new IP address on every new line. Failure to do so will result in an error. However, if you paste directly from Elastic, there should be no problem fixing the syntax.

I will be adding new features from time to time depends on my schedule.
